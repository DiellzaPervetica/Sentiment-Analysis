"Very nice place in the center of Pristina, it was a nice time. Very friendly staff just right everything you have the feeling like in a luxury country like Dubai so also the reception of staff, we are very satisfied. I can only recommend",positive
"Swiss Diamond is located in the heart of Pristine, hotel is somehow small with a nice hotel, a lobby bar and a spa.
This hotel has excellent front desk and concierge team, always smiling and ready to help.
Rooms are spacious but bathrooms are even larger than bed rooms which is simply amazing!",positive
"Wonderful Hotel with Outstanding Service. This is our third stay at this hotel with “Old World Charm”. The chambermaids do an excellent job keeping the room not only clean, but replacing whatever is used among the nicely accessorised bathroom. The food was excellent and the service in the restaurant and lounge was impeccable! We greatly appreciated the lounge hours as we could work there in the mornings and enjoy the evenings until late. Excellent stay all three times, simply the finest hotel in Prishtina; in fact one of our favourite hotels. Thank you Swiss Diamond! We had a great time.",positive
"Better than expected. Nice and comfortable rooms, excellent breakfast and spa, friendly staff. Quiet and peaceful, I did not hear any traffic. Pays off to stay there, services exceed price. Real five stars, indeed. Location is perfect, the walking zone of Priština.",positive

Swiss Diamond is our home from home. We absolutely love staying there when we visit Pristina. The location is so convenient and central. The breakfast is fantastic and the spa is amazing. Thank you to all the team for making us feel so welcome and for being so attentive. Many thanks to Rea for helping us with all our reservations too. The rooms are quiet and comfortable plus the hotel is pet-friendly. We will definitely be back soon.,positive
"What a beautiful and superb 5 star hotel in central Pristina! Luxury restaurant, delicious breakfast, amazing spa and heated pool guaranteed excellent stay for two days. The room was silent and personnel was very friendly. There were several good cafes and restaurants nearby.",positive
We stayed at the hotel for five days and we really liked it. In the middle of the city you can reach everything on foot! Free parking! Great breakfast and incomparable spa! The staff always friendly and helpful! What more do you want?,positive
"Wow, where to begin??? First, expected a bit more given all the very good and excellent reviews. the decor is quite over the top and a little stuffy-sorta stuck in a bygone era. But different strokes for different folks I guess. The gym is pretty small with outdated equipment, and a behemoth of a machine that’s air operated? I couldn’t work it out - literally. barely any free weights for a guy calorie burn. The smoggy Prishtina air was somehow making it into my room nightly. Perhaps someone smoking next door even though it’s a strict no smoking hotel.

The big kicker for those self-sufficient types NO IRONS/IRONING BOARDS!!! ",neutral
"If you want to be a 5 star hotel, issues like that make a very bad impression. It's probably one of the best hotels in Pristina, but I am not sure I'd come back taking into account the high price you pay for the room!",neutral
The business deluxe room was - average although the bathroom probably on the mark for a hotel in this class. But on a business trip I found myself having to use the hotel ironing service as they wont provide irons in the room. Its a common scam in this part of the world and €6 euros for 2 minutes work is ridiculous. Reception gave me the impression the service was free. Scam.,neutral
"Great location in the centre of town. Good staff, and a decent spread for breakfast. The decor in the room was a little over the top, and we had to call reception to fix the LED lights as none of the switches worked. Would recommend for a stay but maybe better suited as a business hotel. I wouldn't call it 5*, maybe 4* is more suitable for the amenities.",neutral
"During this visit, our team from Company stayed in five individual rooms. Upon check-out, one of receptionists, a female staff member named ERNESTO or ERNESTINO what else , displayed unbelievably disrespectful, rude, and arrogant behavior, which caused significant disappointment.",negative
"HydraFacial was not only a complete joke (aesthetician clearly has no idea how to actually perform a facial), improper use of the machine left me with broken blood vessels all over my face",negative
"No sound proofing to the windows can hear everything out side.
Booking was made online but hotel had no track of it…… twice.
Air con didn’t work
Lights in room wouldn’t turn off.
Room are nice but very loud!
Staff pretty nice but not ver accommodating.",negative
"Myself, my cousin and a colleague of mine from London visited Swiss Diamond Hotel. We sat down for dinner. The service from start to finish, was not to the standard of a 5 star hotel, this score should be reviewed. We ordered from the Menu, part from feeling rushed and not welcomed, we stayed to eat. We ordered numeorus dishes, honestly the starters were very well presented and tasted good. When the Mains came, what I had ordered took ages to arrive, even though it was a very empty restaurant. Their was no waiters/waitress available to query the dish, my colleague had to get up himself and look for someone to serve us. ",negative
"Hotel room we stayed in 624, was left un cleaned, used shampoo bottles left in shower, smelly bidet, dirty sink, no light in shower, had to use the hand held shower in the bath, female reception staff rude, 20-30min wait for car park. Cars are parked one after another, getting in and out was a struggle. Called reception about an unironed shirt and they refused to send someone up, I demanded a staff come up as the service being provided by staff was appalling. Hotel staff advised due to being full house, being a 5 star hotel that’s no excuse.",negative
"This place is completely mediocre. Anyone who claims otherwise is either related to the hotel owner or has never been to a decent hotel in their entire life. Cheap, gaudy, threadbare furniture, uncomfortable mattresses, and miserable, cold staff from the front desk to the restaurant. ",negative
This hotel is a disgrace. For the 5 star rating - it’s absolutely not up to standard. One look at how menu is described and you will be convinced. The price we pay here would surely assure a more accurate description of dishes and more accurate translations. Ordered a chicken dish- cauliflowers well done but found plenty of ham which was never even mentioned. ,negative
"Sin. what was once an excellent address now turns out to be a pretentious hotel but one that offers very little. Rooms not clean, taps in the bathroom ruined, food absolutely not up to a ""5"" (?) star rating. Even the breakfast, once truly excellent, is now starting to decline in quality.",negative
The pillows are like cement bags. Hotel is rococo in design. Service is truly hit and miss. Staff are very friendly but totally inefficient. ,neutral
"Staying at Swiss Diamond Hotel was amazing. Everybody was so nice and helpful, the food was splendid and the swimming pool was so relaxing. I ordered dinner by room service and was served a perfectly cooked salmon in my room. Perfect after a long days work.",positive
